This repository contains examples of data science projects I have completed. 

The PPP project examines relationships between loans granted by the Paycheck Protection Program of the Small Business Association (SBA) and changes in employment by industry type during 2020 and 2021. This project focuses on preprocessing a sizeable loan dataset (11.8 million rows, 50+ columns) and an employment dataset, and then uses regression to identify predictors of employment outcomes through June 2021. For ease of access, the PPP data can be downloaded from [my Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KqJAXW8FDkdEfZJHT3iE5NxYdCCerVDV?usp=sharing) or the [SBA](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program/ppp-data) and the employment data can be accessed from [this Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xKxKv9n1uCzRECSJFsvgRW1hQ-UepoSy?usp=sharing) or the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/employment-levels-by-industry.htm).

The Garment Worker Productivity project analyzes a Kaggle dataset of employee productivity and numerous features of the garment manufacturing manufacturing process. The "Garment Worker Productivity - comparing predictive models" notebook preprocesses, encodes, and scales data before comparing the performance of a variety of models, inlcuding a neural network, in predicting garment worker productivity.
